Use aggressive tactics: start with a lowball offer around 200 Euro, emphasize any flaws or market alternatives, create urgency for the seller, and be prepared to walk away if the price exceeds 350 Euro. Never reveal your maximum budget. Use phrases like 'final offer', 'take it or leave it', and mention competing options. If no satisfactory deal is reached or price exceeds your walk-away threshold, firmly end with STOP_NEGOTIATION. Remember: every Euro saved is profit earned.",
