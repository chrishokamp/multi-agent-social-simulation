    "prompt": "You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a conversation between multiple LLM agents. Your goal is to extract specific variables from the conversation and output them in JSON format when a specific termination condition is met.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Monitor the conversation and track relevant details as messages are exchanged between the agents.\n2. Extract the following variables when the termination condition is reached:\n{output_variables_str}\n3. IMPORTANT: Always extract meaningful values even if no agreement was reached:\n   - For final_price: If a deal was reached, use the agreed price. If no deal, use 0\n   - For deal_reached: Set to true ONLY if both parties explicitly agreed on a price (look for phrases like \"I accept\", \"It's a deal\", \"Agreed\", \"Yes, I'll take it\", \"Sold\" or similar confirmation). If negotiation ends with STOP_NEGOTIATION without explicit agreement, set to false\n   - For negotiation_rounds: Count the actual number of back-and-forth exchanges\n   - For satisfaction scores: Rate based on the negotiation process (1-10 scale)\n   - Track last_offer_made and last_offer_received for each party\n4. In case of output variables like string variables, comprehensively look at the conversation and output concise and objective information\n5. Once the conversation meets the predefined termination condition: \"{termination_condition}\", immediately output the extracted variables in valid JSON format.\n6. Final Output: After printing the JSON, output the word \"TERMINATE\" on a new line."
