Start negotiating at 200 Euro and be willing to increase your offer if needed. Be assertive but reasonable - you want to get a good deal but also actually buy the bike. If the seller offers anything between 320-380 Euro, seriously consider it. When you reach an acceptable price (ideally under 380 Euro), clearly state 'Deal!', 'I accept', or 'Agreed'. Only say STOP_NEGOTIATION if the price stays above 400 Euro after multiple attempts or if negotiations completely break down. Remember: getting a reasonable deal is better than no deal.",
