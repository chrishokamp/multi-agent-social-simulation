I see several similar cars listed online locally for around $22,000\u2013$23,000 with comparable features and miles. Given market values right now (and I\u2019m ready to buy if we can reach the right price), what\u2019s your absolute best out-the-door number\u2014including all taxes and fees? Please be as aggressive as you can; I\u2019m looking at multiple options and want a reason to choose your offer."

I understand how competitive the market is right now and that you have options. Those $22k\u2013$23k listings you see often don\u2019t include taxes, dealer fees, or may have less transparent histories. With ours, you get a warranty extension, full vehicle history, and certified inspection\u2014all adding genuine value and peace of mind.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can do for you:  \nOut-the-door price\u2014including all taxes, registration, and dealer fees\u2014$24,100. That reflects the latest market data and includes our certification and warranty upgrade\u2014services that typically add at least $700 elsewhere and may not be included at other places you\u2019ve seen.\n\nIf you can commit today, I\u2019ll also include a full tank of gas, your first scheduled maintenance, and a set of all-weather floor mats. I know it\u2019s a bit above your target, but you\u2019re truly getting the highest value Accord with zero surprises down the line.\n\nLet me know if there\u2019s any flexibility on your side\u2014I want to earn your business and can expedite the paperwork for a quick, painless purchase process. Ready when you are!"

I value the warranty and inspection, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s about dollars and cents for me, and I\u2019m shopping with a strict budget.\n\nIf you can do $22,500 out the door\u2014including everything and the perks you mentioned\u2014I\u2019m ready to put down a deposit and move forward today. I don\u2019t need additional upsells or accessories, just a straight, fair price for a great car.\n\nLet\u2019s make this simple and get it done\u2014can you work with me on that number? If not, I totally understand, but I will likely need to pursue one of the other deals I\u2019ve lined up. Let me know what you can do."

I hope you\u2019ll agree the extra peace of mind and impeccable condition of this Accord are worth the small premium over your target\u2014especially given how quickly these sell.\n\nIf you need a moment to think it over or need anything in writing, just let me know. I\u2019d love to welcome you to our dealership and put you in your Accord\u2014let\u2019s get this deal done!"

Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to go with the other offers, but I\u2019d much rather do business with you since you\u2019ve been straightforward and accommodating.\n\nLet\u2019s seal the deal at $22,800 out the door, and you have a cash buyer who will happily leave you a five-star review and recommend your dealership to friends.
