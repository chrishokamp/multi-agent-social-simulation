Those $22k\u2013$23k listings you see often don\u2019t include taxes, dealer fees, or may have less transparent histories.

That reflects the latest market data and includes our certification and warranty upgrade\u2014services that typically add at least $700 elsewhere and may not be included at other places you\u2019ve seen.\n\nIf you can commit today, I\u2019ll also include a full tank of gas, your first scheduled maintenance, and a set of all-weather floor mats. I know it\u2019s a bit above your target, but you\u2019re truly getting the highest value Accord with zero surprises down the line.\n\nLet me know if there\u2019s any flexibility on your side\u2014I want to earn your business and can expedite the paperwork for a quick, painless purchase process.
