I really do appreciate the extras\u2014the new tires, all-weather mats, fresh oil, and full tank certainly make life easier for me right off the bat.\n\nThat said, $24,200 is getting close, but I\u2019d like to do just a bit better. If you can meet me at $23,800, we have a deal right now: I can bring certified funds and handle all paperwork as soon as you\u2019re ready. You get a serious buyer and a fast, smooth transaction\u2014no endless haggling or showings.\n\nLet\u2019s shake on $23,800 and both walk away happy\u2014what do you say?"
