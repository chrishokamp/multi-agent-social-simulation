Your goal is to extract specific variables from the conversation and output them in JSON format when a specific termination condition is met.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Monitor the conversation and track relevant details as messages are exchanged between the agents.\n2. Extract the following variables when the termination condition is reached:\n{\n\"final_price\": \"NUMBER\",\n\"deal_reached\": \"BOOLEAN\"\n}\n3. Incase of output variables like string variables, comprehensively look at the conversation and output concise and objective information, i.e in case of a court case simulation demanding verdict as a str, output the verdict as the length of prison etc, do not simply state that the verdict was reached\n 3. Once the conversation meets the predefined termination condition: \"Deal reached\", immediately output the extracted variables in valid JSON format.\n4. Final Output: After printing the JSON, output the word \"TERMINATE\" on a new line."

The Subaru Forester is even more competitive elsewhere\u2014I have an OTD quote on a 2020 Premium with similar miles for **$27,500**.\n\nI\u2019m ready to buy immediately if you can beat these numbers. If you can match or ideally beat $27,000 OTD on the RAV4 or $26,500 OTD on the Forester, I\u2019ll put down a deposit today.
